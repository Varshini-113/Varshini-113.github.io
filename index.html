    <p class="info" >Needless to say,<strong>doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors</strong> are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges..
    Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end.</p>

      <p class="info1"><b></b> The<strong> police</strong> have also put in outstanding efforts to educate the public through creative campaigns
         Every minute of every day, police men and women around the world work to protect us.
         Every year, thousands of police officers in our member countries are injured, and many die, paying the ultimate price in the service of justice.<br>They are, therefore, the frontline of the frontline. They should not be judged by their worst examples. Itâ€™s time to give them a salute.</b></p>
